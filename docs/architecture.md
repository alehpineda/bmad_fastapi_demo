# Pokémon FastAPI API - System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture for the Pokémon-themed FastAPI demo application, a reference project for the BMAD methodology. The system is a lightweight, containerized RESTful API that provides basic CRUD-like functionality for Pokémon data.

The core purpose is to serve as a "golden path" example, demonstrating a clean, modern, and testable backend architecture. It is designed to be simple, stateless, and easily understandable, prioritizing clarity and best practices over feature complexity. The architecture will emphasize a strong separation of concerns, robust testing, and a streamlined CI/CD process to support the project's goal of being a high-quality reference implementation.

## 2. Architectural Principles and Constraints

The following principles and constraints will guide the design and implementation of this project:

*   **Simplicity and Clarity:** The architecture will prioritize simplicity and ease of understanding. As a reference implementation, the primary goal is to be instructive, not complex. We will choose the most straightforward path that meets the requirements.
*   **Testability:** Every component of the system will be designed with testability as a primary concern. This supports the NFR of 90% test coverage and ensures the project is a high-quality example of a test-driven approach.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The application will be structured using a clean architecture pattern. Logic will be distinctly separated into layers (e.g., presentation/API, business logic, data access) to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
*   **Statelessness:** The API will be entirely stateless. No session data will be stored on the server between requests, which simplifies the design and prepares it for potential future scalability.
*   **Containerization:** The application is designed to be run within a Docker container from the outset (FR4). All development and testing will be done with this in mind, ensuring the environment is consistent and portable.
*   **Technology Stack Constraints:** The technology choices are explicitly constrained by the PRD:
    *   **Language:** Python 3.13
    *   **Framework:** FastAPI (latest stable version)
    *   **Dependency Management:** `uv`
    *   **Testing Framework:** `pytest`
*   **In-Memory Data Store:** The system will use a simple in-memory Python list or dictionary for data storage. No external database will be used, as per the "Out of Scope" section of the PRD.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The application will be structured using a layered architecture, which separates the code into distinct components, each with a specific responsibility. This promotes a clean separation of concerns and follows the principles outlined in the previous section.

The primary layers are:

1.  **API Layer (Presentation):**
    *   **Responsibility:** This is the entry point for all external requests. It is responsible for handling HTTP protocols, parsing incoming request data, and formatting the final HTTP response.
    *   **Implementation:** This layer will be implemented using FastAPI routers. It will define the API endpoints (`/pokemon`) and handle request/response validation using Pydantic models. It will delegate all business logic to the Service Layer.

2.  **Service Layer (Business Logic):**
    *   **Responsibility:** This layer contains the core application logic. It orchestrates the steps required to fulfill a use case (e.g., creating a new Pokémon). It is completely independent of the web framework (FastAPI) and the data storage mechanism.
    *   **Implementation:** This will be a set of Python classes or functions that are called by the API Layer. It will use the Repository Layer to access data.

3.  **Repository Layer (Data Access):**
    *   **Responsibility:** This layer abstracts the data storage mechanism. Its sole purpose is to provide a simple, consistent interface for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data, without exposing the underlying storage details.
    *   **Implementation:** For this project, this layer will manage the in-memory list of Pokémon. It will expose functions like `get_all_pokemon()` and `add_pokemon()`. This design means we could easily swap the in-memory store for a real database in the future without changing the Service or API layers.

4.  **Domain Model Layer:**
    *   **Responsibility:** This layer defines the core data structures of the application.
    *   **Implementation:** These will be Pydantic models (e.g., a `Pokemon` class) that are used across all other layers to ensure data consistency.

### Request Flow Example (POST /pokemon)

1.  An HTTP `POST` request with Pokémon data arrives at the **API Layer**.
2.  FastAPI validates the incoming JSON against the `Pokemon` Pydantic model.
3.  The API Layer calls the `create_pokemon` method on the **Service Layer**.
4.  The Service Layer orchestrates the operation and calls the `add_pokemon` method on the **Repository Layer**.
5.  The Repository Layer adds the new Pokémon to the in-memory list.
6.  The result is returned up through the layers, and the API Layer sends a `201 Created` HTTP response.

## 4. Data Model and API Specification

### 4.1. Data Model

The core data entity for this application is the `Pokemon`. We will define it using a Pydantic model, which will give us automatic data validation and serialization.

**`Pokemon` Model:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Pokemon(BaseModel):
    id: int = Field(..., description="The unique identifier for the Pokémon")
    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the Pokémon")
    type: str = Field(..., description="The primary type of the Pokémon (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass)")
```

### 4.2. API Endpoints

The API will expose two endpoints as defined in the functional requirements.

**1. Get All Pokémon**

*   **Description:** Retrieves a list of all Pokémon currently in the data store.
*   **Endpoint:** `GET /pokemon`
*   **Request Body:** None
*   **Success Response:**
    *   **Code:** `200 OK`
    *   **Body:** A JSON array of Pokémon objects.
        ```json
        [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Pikachu",
            "type": "Electric"
          }
        ]
        ```

**2. Create a New Pokémon**

*   **Description:** Adds a new Pokémon to the data store.
*   **Endpoint:** `POST /pokemon`
*   **Request Body:** A JSON object representing the new Pokémon.
    ```json
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Charmander",
      "type": "Fire"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response:**
    *   **Code:** `201 Created`
    *   **Body:** The newly created Pokémon object.
        ```json
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Charmander",
          "type": "Fire"
        }
        ```
*   **Error Response (Example):**
    *   **Code:** `422 Unprocessable Entity` (if the request body is invalid)
    *   **Body:** A JSON object detailing the validation error.

## 5. Project and Directory Structure

The project will follow a standard Python project layout that reflects the layered architecture and separates application code from tests and configuration.

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline

A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline will be implemented using GitHub Actions. This pipeline will automate the process of testing and packaging the application, ensuring that every change is automatically validated.

The workflow will be defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and will be triggered on every `push` and `pull_request` to the `master` branch.

The pipeline will consist of the following sequential jobs:

1.  **Setup Environment:**
    *   This initial step checks out the code.
    *   It sets up Python 3.13.
    *   It installs `uv` and uses it to install all project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`. This ensures a consistent and fast setup for the following jobs.

2.  **Linting:**
    *   **Purpose:** To enforce a consistent code style and catch common programming errors before they are integrated.
    *   **Tool:** We will use **Ruff** to ensure the codebase adheres to **PEP 8** style guidelines.
    *   **Action:** The job will run `ruff` across the entire `app` directory. If any linting errors are found, the pipeline will fail, preventing the merge of poor-quality code.

3.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   **Purpose:** To verify that all business logic and API endpoints function as expected.
    *   **Tool:** `pytest` will be used to discover and run the tests.
    *   **Action:** The job will execute all tests within the `tests/` directory. It will also generate a code coverage report to ensure we are meeting the 90% coverage requirement (NFR4). If any test fails, the pipeline will fail.

4.  **Build Docker Image:**
    *   **Purpose:** To package the application into a portable Docker image, ready for execution.
    *   **Action:** This job will only run if the "Linting" and "Unit Testing" jobs succeed. It will use the `Dockerfile` in the root of the project to build the application image.
    *   **Security:** The `Dockerfile` will be configured to use a non-root user and a `python-slim` base image, as per FR4.
    *   **Note:** As per the "Out of Scope" section, this job will build the image but will not push it to a container registry.
