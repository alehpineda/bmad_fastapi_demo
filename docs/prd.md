# Pokémon-themed FastAPI Demo Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   Successfully deliver the Pokémon-themed FastAPI project using the BMAD methodology from inception to completion within the next development sprint.
*   Establish a "golden path" reference implementation to be used as the official guide and template for future agentic AI development.
*   Ensure the engineering team reports high confidence in applying the BMAD process to their daily tasks.
*   Reduce process friction and time spent debating *how* to build with agentic AI.
*   Enable developers and QA engineers to independently use the completed project as a guide for new tasks.

### Background Context

The current landscape of Agentic AI development is a "wild west" without established standards, leading to inconsistent and inefficient project execution. This project directly addresses this problem by creating a practical, hands-on reference implementation of the Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development (BMAD).

By using the universally recognized Pokémon theme and the popular FastAPI framework, we will create an accessible, end-to-end example. This will serve as the definitive starting point for our team, providing a clear, repeatable framework to guide all future agentic AI development, bringing much-needed structure and predictability to this innovative domain.

## Requirements

### Functional

*   **FR1:** The API must provide a `GET` endpoint to retrieve a list of Pokémon.
*   **FR2:** The API must provide a `POST` endpoint to add a new Pokémon to the list.
*   **FR3:** The project must include a suite of unit tests that validate the functionality of the `GET` and `POST` endpoints.
*   **FR4:** The API must be able to run inside a Docker container that does not have root access and is based on a python-slim image.

### Non-Functional

*   **NFR1:** The project must use `uv` for environment and dependency management.
*   **NFR2:** The project must be developed using Python 3.13.
*   **NFR3:** The project must use the latest stable version of the FastAPI framework.
*   **NFR4:** The project must achieve a minimum of 90% unit test coverage.
*   **NFR5:** A CI/CD workflow must be implemented using GitHub Actions, which includes steps for code linting, running unit tests, and building a Docker image.
*   **NFR6:** The project must use `pytest` as its unit testing framework.

## Technical Assumptions

*   The initial version of the API will use a simple in-memory list to store Pokémon data. A persistent database is considered out of scope for this initial implementation.
*   The application will be stateless. Each API request will be treated as an independent transaction that does not rely on previous requests.
*   The project will follow a standard, clean architecture pattern suitable for FastAPI to ensure the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and easy to test.
*   The CI/CD pipeline implemented in GitHub Actions will be configured to run automatically on every push and pull request to the `master` branch.

## Out of Scope

To ensure the project remains focused on its primary goal as a reference implementation, the following features and activities are explicitly out of scope for this version:

*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** The API will be public and will not include any user management or security features.
*   **Persistent Database Storage:** The application will use a simple in-memory data store. Integration with a database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a NoSQL alternative is not included.
*   **Rate Limiting:** There will be no mechanism to limit the number of requests a client can make to the API.
*   **Production Deployment and Hosting:** While a Docker image will be created, the process of deploying it to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and managing the infrastructure is not part of this project.
*   **Comprehensive API Documentation Generation:** Beyond the default documentation provided by FastAPI, no additional documentation (e.g., a dedicated documentation site) will be created.
*   **Additional API Endpoints:** Any endpoints beyond the core `GET` (list) and `POST` (create) for Pokémon are out of scope. This includes `GET` (by ID), `PUT`/`PATCH`, and `DELETE`.
