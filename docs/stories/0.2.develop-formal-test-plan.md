# Story 0.2: Develop Formal Test Plan

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** member of the development team,
**I want** a formal and documented test plan,
**so that** we have a shared, authoritative guide for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new document is created at `docs/test-plan.md`.
2. The test plan explicitly defines the strategy for **Unit Testing**, stating that each application layer (API, Service, Repository) should be tested in isolation.
3. The test plan defines the strategy for **Integration Testing**, specifying that FastAPI's `TestClient` will be used to test the full request-to-response flow.
4. The test plan mandates that the CI pipeline **must** execute the entire test suite (unit and integration) inside the final, built Docker container to ensure environment parity.
5. The test plan defines the strategy for **API Edge Case Testing**, specifying that `pytest`'s parameterization will be used to test invalid data submissions, missing fields, and other boundary conditions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
*   **[x] Task 1: Create the Test Plan Document (AC: #1)**
    *   [x] Create a new file named `test-plan.md` inside the `docs/` directory.
    *   [x] Add the main title: `# Test Plan`.

*   **[x] Task 2: Draft the Unit Testing Strategy (AC: #2)**
    *   [x] Create a section titled `## Unit Testing`.
    *   [x] Write a paragraph explaining that the goal of unit tests is to validate each component in isolation.
    *   [x] Specify that mocks and stubs will be used to isolate layers (e.g., when testing the Service Layer, the Repository Layer will be mocked).

*   **[x] Task 3: Draft the Integration Testing Strategy (AC: #3)**
    *   [x] Create a section titled `## Integration Testing`.
    *   [x] Explain that integration tests will validate the connections between layers.
    *   [x] State that `FastAPI.TestClient` will be used to make HTTP requests to the application's endpoints and assert the responses.

*   **[x] Task 4: Draft the In-Container Testing Strategy (AC: #4)**
    *   [x] Create a section titled `## In-Container Testing`.
    *   [x] Emphasize that this is a critical step to ensure environment parity.
    *   [x] Specify that the CI/CD pipeline must be configured to execute the full `pytest` suite within the Docker container after the image is built.

*   **[x] Task 5: Draft the API Edge Case Testing Strategy (AC: #5)**
    *   [x] Create a section titled `## API Edge Case and Validation Testing`.
    *   [x] State that `pytest.mark.parametrize` will be the primary tool for this.
    *   [x] Provide examples of edge cases to be tested for the `POST /pokemon` endpoint, such as missing fields, incorrect data types, and duplicate IDs.

## Dev Notes
This story is a direct result of the "Develop Test Plan" recommendation from the Product Owner's Master Validation checklist. The primary goal is to formalize the high-level testing strategies identified by the QA Architect during their initial review.

**Key Inputs:**
*   **`docs/prd.md`**: The PRD specifies the 90% code coverage requirement (NFR4) and the use of `pytest` (NFR6).
*   **`docs/architecture.md`**: The architecture document defines the layered structure that necessitates both unit and integration testing. It also specifies the CI/CD pipeline where these tests will be run.
*   **QA Architect's Early Input**: The core content of the test plan should be based on the high-risk areas identified by the QA Architect:
    1.  Layer Integration Points (requires integration tests).
    2.  Containerization and Environment Parity (requires in-container testing).
    3.  API Contract and Edge Cases (requires parameterized testing).

The agent assigned to this story should synthesize these inputs into a clear and concise `test-plan.md` document.

### Testing
This story is about creating the test plan itself; therefore, no new application tests are required. The success of this story will be measured by the quality and completeness of the `docs/test-plan.md` document.
